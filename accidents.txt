Just a few short anecdotes of things gone wrong in the labd:

20:19 < PeterM> i have a few of the lower power versions, they're good - but dont like you putting 
                mains voltage on the inputs :P
20:20 < PeterM> i often have a set of dmm probes plugged into them with a current  limit set and use 
                that to check diods Vf and the like
20:21 < PeterM> i also happen to use the same style of probes for my dmm
20:21 < PeterM> one thing leads to another and you're accidentalyl probing your pfc output with your 
                powersupply not your dmm



04:23 < dongs> i think i need to relax a bit. puchend some holes in wall and threw my phone this 
               morning over jap company raging me the fuck out



03:07 < englishman> zyp, had a chance to test out a gfci circuit
03:07 < englishman> i'm alive
03:07 < englishman> sure am glad i installed that
