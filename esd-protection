20:42 < Thorn> so here is a 5V ESD/TVS diode, standoff voltage 5V, breakdown 6...8V, worst case 
               clamping voltage 8.7V. I tend do think e.g. a 5V-tolerant pin would be dead @ 8.7V. 
               what do
20:42 < Thorn> series resistor between it and the pin?
20:43 < Thorn> 5V-tolerant STM32 pin
20:43 < kakimir> it clamping voltage at rated current
20:43 < kakimir> usually some current at least
20:43 < kakimir> marked in datasheet
20:44 < kakimir> voltage can get even higher
20:44 < Thorn> it's at 1A. up to 30V @16A
20:45 < kakimir> so it's pretty small
20:58 -!- Gerritjan [~quassel@ip4da12a64.direct-adsl.nl] has quit [Remote host closed the connection]
21:07 < PeterM> you gfot this on a power rail or jsut a gpio?
21:07 < PeterM> if gpio fukken series resistor that shit
21:07 < kakimir> yes
21:08 < kakimir> both sides of TVS series resistor?
21:08 < kakimir> gpio side only?
21:08 < PeterM> either
21:09 < kakimir> or both?
21:09 < PeterM> p.much
21:09 < kakimir> it's however you like it?
21:10 < PeterM> it would be more effective on the input to the tvs 
21:10 < PeterM> but it is still effective on the output to a large degree
21:11 < kakimir> sometimes you can TVS the powerrail and then schottky them IOs to rail
21:11 < kakimir> and series resistors to those schottkys
21:11 < PeterM> i'd not do that
