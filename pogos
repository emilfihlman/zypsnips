05:05 < dongs> dude my typical bed of nails uses like 20-50 of these
05:05 < dongs> so yeah...?
05:06 < dongs> i mean if you are making one fucking connector jsut buy and shut up
05:06 < dongs> and use them later in other shit'
05:06 < dongs> sometimes i add several gnd points per board

23:19 < lurchi_> karlp: I have some pogos here which are about 70% the size of the Hirschmann MPS
23:20 < lurchi_> fine enough for contacting 0.4mm pitch if you can arrange them in zigzag fashion
23:21 < lurchi_> price each is about 0.05â‚¬ if you buy 50
23:32 < lurchi_> just search for P50-B1 (sharp tip), P50-J1 (round tip)
