For tiny RTC crystals

01:23 < dongs> FC-135 i used on teh dildo is tiny
01:23 < dongs> (rtc xtal)
01:23 < zyp> what's the usual footprint for SMT 32k crystals?
01:24 < dongs> and that one is avialable a lot
01:24 < zyp> ah, I'll go for that then

For tiny HSE crystals

10:44 < dongs> cheap 3225 ends at 12MHz, 24 and up can be 2016 package
10:44 < dongs> 8MHz is available in 3225 but expensive as shit

=> check with your ref man if you need bootloader support, but using a
   12/24mhz crystal will be cheaper and smaller than 8mhz
